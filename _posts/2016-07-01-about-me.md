# About Me

_" I love .... Love. " - Leya Russell_

Hi my name's Leya and I love being a photographer and connecting with people.  
I believe that every photograph contains at least two people; the subject and the photographer- so let me tell you, we're in this together! I spend my days and nights putting people in their best light, uplifting their sprits and having fun. Next I bring beautiful, meaningful images into post production and combine my love of photography, drawing and storytelling into creating beautiful images, custom albums, incredible wall art and heartwarming slideshows. What can I say?... I love what I do!!

My true passion and specialty is creating emotive portraits of people.

I have a degree in fine art photography, and have been working as a photographer for the last six years. I have worked side by side with Edward Ross of www.edwardrossphotography.com the past 4 wedding seasons and over 150 events. 

Many exciting things have happened this past year- my first magazine editorials were just published in the 4th edition of Luxe by Calgary Bride magazine. I was recently awarded people's choice for "Emerging Photographer of the Year 2015" by Exposure Festival. My work "Sadhu in Kathmandu" was selected by National Geographic Daily Dozen and featured on their website (truly a childhood dream come true!). 'Black Gold' - a major Alberta Foundation of the Arts TREX Exhibition, I was featured in came to a close after 3 years of extensive travel throughout Alberta. I have been all over the world; this spring traveling to Myanmar, Taiwan and Japan following my passion for travel photography. As if that was not enough for one year, I was also fortunate enough to take part in a National Geographic expedition to Nepal and Tibet and my photos from that trip were included in several exhibitions.  
On a more personal note, my daughter has started junior high and I could not be more proud of her! I am young, full of drive, eager to continue learning and improving on my skills. 

I believe that moments are brief and should be captured in a way that connects our future to our past. Let's make some magic happen!
