# Travel Images

Life is a journey and I love to travel!! I have a passion for different cultures and places. Such a curiosity about our human race. I feel a true sense of awe experiencing how diverse environments, ideas, choices and many more indistinguishable details result in so many unique and beautiful ways of life. Photography allows me to tell these stories. My image enable me to share this curious perspective.

I have been so lucky and have explored many exotic places! To name but a few- India, New Zealand, China, Tibet, Nepal and most recently Taiwan and Myanmar. My favourite place is always the last place I traveled to and at the moment my heart is in Myanmar. In Burma the people are sweet and smily. Lovely, just lovely.
