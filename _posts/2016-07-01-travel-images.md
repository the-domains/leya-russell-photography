  Life is a journey and I love to travel!! I have a passion for different
  cultures and places. Such a curiosity about our human race. I feel a true
  sense of awe experiencing how diverse environments, ideas, decisions and many,
  many more indistinguishable details can result in so many unique, beautiful
  ways of life. Photography allows me to tell these stories, a way to share this
  curious perspective.

# Travel Images

Life is a journey and I love to travel!! I have a passion for different cultures and places. Such a curiosity about our human race. I feel a true sense of awe experiencing how diverse environments, ideas, decisions and many, many more indistinguishable details can result in so many unique, beautiful ways of life. Photography allows me to tell these stories, a way to share this curious perspective.

I have been so lucky exploring many exotic places! To name but a few- India, New Zealand, China, Tibet, Nepal and most recently Taiwan and Myanmar. My favourite place is always the last place I traveled to and at the moment my heart is in Myanmar. In Burma the people are sweet and smily, lovely, just lovely.
